- 👋 Hi, I’m Eunji  :woman: :speech_balloon:  :palm_tree: :kr: :coffee:
- 👀 I'm driven by front-end development and find myself humbly drawn to the harmonious integration of web design and development, seeking to create visually captivating webpages that not only reflect my artistic vision but also resonate deeply with the aspirations of discerning clientele. Embracing the principles of Design Thinking, I am dedicated to placing people at the core of every process, allowing empathy to guide my decisions. With a strong commitment to user-centered design, I strive to carefully consider and cater to user needs, stakeholder goals, and technical capabilities, seamlessly weaving them together to deliver digital experiences that transcend expectations and drive meaningful impact for businesses.
- 🌱 I am currently honing my skills in front-end development through Codecademy's front-end engineering path.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that merge design and development to deliver engaging and purposeful web experiences.
